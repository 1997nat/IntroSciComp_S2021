-	Name, family, where you are from and where you live now
-	Major/program, year 
-	Computing and data analysis experience: what software or computing environments you have used, mathematical and statistical training, any data analysis experience
-	Available computational resources: what computer resources do you have access to, what is your internet situation and who do you have to share it with
-	Experience with online learning, what has worked well and what didn’t work, suggestions for how to organize the class and grading policies

Go over syllabus in detail

Basic schedule (all class activities are over Zoom):
2-3 Lecture and discussion all together, examples and guided exercises
These will be recorded
Break
3:15-4:45 Lab work time in breakout rooms with a buddy system and support

Schedule of topics

Introduction to Slack, github, datacamp and Anaconda

Break, set up breakout rooms

# Lab 1.1 (Due Tuesday by midnight):
1.	Join the class slack channel (use this link) and send Dr. H a message
2.	Sign up for a github account. Choose your github username wisely. Send Dr. H your github username over slack so you can be added to our course github channel (https://github.com/chsharrison/IntroSciComp_S2021)
3.	Join the class datacamp site: https://www.datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/96ff084a0a95597bb08bf597cb995c823c7041873195170fc80655ecd5a33436. Navigate to the assignments page.
4.	In datacamp, complete your first assignment: Introduction to Python, Ch 1 “Python Basics”
5.	Get Anaconda installed on your computer
  1.	Make sure you have Jupyter Lab (python notebooks), QT console (interactive or ipython), and Spyder installed
  2.	Open ipython/QT console and run the four code examples in the last exercise in the datacamp “Introduction to Python” first chapter we did on Monday (“Can Python handle everything?”). Note that the ipython console is what the bottom datacamp interactive window uses.
  1.	Enter the same four code examples again both in Jupyter interactive notebook and Spyder. Make sure you know how to execute code in each of these interfaces.	
  2.	Play around with these different coding interfaces and practicing some of the code you learned in datacamp
6.	Turn in your work on Blackboard submit screenshots of:
  1.	your completed chapter on datacamp
  2.	your work on the ipython, jupyter notebook and spyder interfaces
